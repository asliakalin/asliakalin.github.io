						<h1> Asli Akalin </h1>
						<h2> B.A in Computer Science & B.A in Economics
						 </h2>

						 <p> I'm junior studying in UC Berkeley, pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Economics and minoring in Math. I am interested in data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning as well as algorithms, CS theory and security. Currently I want to focus on mobile development and learn how to develop apps! See you in the iOS decal! </p>
						 
						 <p> This semester, I am taking fun classes like Intro to Artificial Intelligence (CS188), Probability and Random Processes (EE126) and Financial Economics (Econ136), auditing a Machine Learning decal and an Advanced Chinese class! I am also on the course staff for some of my favorite classes in Cal: <i> Efficient Algorithms and Intractable Problems</i> (CS170), <i> Discrete Math and Probability Theory</i> (CS70), and <i> Intro to Teaching Computer Science</i> (CS370)! Apart from classes, I am working with Computer Science Mentors (CSM) as a Senior Mentor for CS70, and as an Associate Mentor for Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (CS61A).  </p>	

						 <p> I have been teaching Discrete Math and Probability Theory (CS70) for 3 semesters in UC Berkeley; last summer I was an undergraduate student instructor and a tutor for Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (CS61A). You can find more detailed information about my section times, office hours and extra materials below: </p>
