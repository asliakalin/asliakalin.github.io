						<h1> Asli Akalin </h1>
						<h2> Computer Science and Economics, BA
						 </h2>

						 <p> I'm an undergraduate student studying in UC Berkeley, pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Economics and minoring in Math. I am interested in data science, web development, artificial intelligence and machine learning as well as algorithms, CS theory and security.</p>
						 <p> I am taking fun classes like Financial Economics (Econ136), Intro to Artificial Intelligence (CS188) and Probability and Random Processes (EE126) and auding a Machine Learning decal and an Advanced Chinese class! This semester I am also on the course staff for some of my favorite classes in Cal: Efficient Algorithms and Intractable Problems (CS170), Discrete Math and Probability Theory (CS70), and Intro to Teaching Computer Science (CS370)! Apart from classes, I am working in Computer Science Mentors (CSM) as a Senior Mentor for CS70, and as an Associate Mentor for Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (CS61A).  </p>	
						 <p> I have been teaching Discrete Math and Probability Theory (CS70) for 3 semesters in UC Berkeley; last summer I was an undergraduate student instructor and a tutor for Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (CS61A). You can find more detailed information about my section times, office hours and extra materials below: </p>
